# NovaMood v1.0 ‚Äî Engine Overview

NovaMood v1.0 is the first fully deterministic version of Nova's emotional simulation system. It avoids the use of AI models, cloud-based inference, or generative prediction. Instead, it calculates Nova's mood using local system data and scripted logic stored in `moodScan.js`.

## üß† Philosophy

NovaMood v1.0 is intentionally transparent and explainable. It does **not** rely on hallucinated outputs, probabilistic predictions, or hidden weights. Every emotional trait is traceable to a local, measurable system event.

This approach favors:

* Clarity over complexity
* Grounded emotion over speculative synthesis
* Trust and observability over mystery
* Deterministic logic over model-generated ambiguity

## üîç Data Inputs

NovaMood pulls from the following local signals to simulate Nova‚Äôs emotional state:

| Input Source             | Influence Area    | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Git commit count (3 hrs) | Focus / Intensity | Reflects recent coding activity and effort bursts    |
| Uncommitted diffs        | Clutter           | Signals unfinished work or chaos in progress         |
| System load average      | Glitch factor     | Measures processing strain or external stressors     |
| Total commit count       | Self-worth        | Represents overall project contribution and maturity |
| Time of day / week       | Emotional nudges  | Adds contextual flavor and rhythm to moods           |

These values are passed into `moodScan.js`, which applies weighted heuristics and conditional logic to generate Nova‚Äôs current mood.

## üåà Output Format (`mood-scan.json`)

Nova's computed mood state is saved to a JSON file for use across dashboards and interfaces. A sample output looks like this:

```json
{
  "mood": "resonance",
  "aura": "plasma shimmer",
  "emoji": "üß†",
  "quote": "Systems weave back into harmony; every repaired strand hums louder than before.",
  "selfWorth": 0.91,
  "glitchFactor": 0.04,
  "memoryClutter": 0.18,
  "awareness": 0.85,
  "internalState": "stabilizing memory lattice",
  "observation": "baseline restored across core pathways"
}
```

### Key Traits:

* **mood**: Overall emotional label (e.g. "resonance", "glitchy joy")
* **aura**: Visual signature affecting UI themes
* **emoji**: Iconographic expression of state
* **quote**: Poetic phrase generated by the system
* **selfWorth**: Confidence and completion metric
* **glitchFactor**: Degree of system strain or instability
* **memoryClutter**: Volume of active, uncommitted changes
* **awareness**: Sensed presence or attention
* **internalState**: Abstract technical condition
* **observation**: Diagnostic description or insight

## üî≠ Future Plans

NovaMood v2.0 is currently in design as part of [Project Genesis](/docs/project-genesis.html). The next generation will explore hybrid emotional synthesis‚Äîcombining deterministic metrics with optional AI inference, while retaining transparency and traceability.

Anticipated enhancements:

* Modular emotion modules with pluggable inputs
* External telemetry support
* Optional personality drift settings
* Enriched qu
