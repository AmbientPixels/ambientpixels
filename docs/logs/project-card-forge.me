# 🃏 RPG Identity Card Studio – Project Kickoff

> *"Everyone’s the hero of their own card."*

---

## 📌 Project Summary

The RPG Identity Card Studio is a creative web app that allows users to design, personalize, and share collectible RPG-style character cards. Originally inspired by internal team cards, this expanded platform supports a broader audience including gamers, creators, teams, and fandoms.

Each card is a stylized identity snapshot—featuring name, class, avatar, stats, powers, achievements, and quotes—rendered in a modular, shareable format.

The system is powered by **Cascade** (the AI agent in Windsurf) and supported by **Nova** (an ambient emotional synthesis AI) for future creative integrations.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Create a flexible UI to generate and render custom RPG identity cards
- Enable embeddable, downloadable, and social-sharing outputs
- Support multiple visual themes (fantasy, sci-fi, professional, pixel, etc.)
- Allow use cases ranging from team recognition to creative portfolios
- Build a future-friendly system ready for decks, remixing, and AI-assisted generation

## 📝 Progress Update (2025-06-26)

- **Azure Function Save Integration:** ✅ Card Forge now saves card data to Azure Blob Storage via `/api/saveCardData`.
- **Asset Loading Fixed:** ✅ All Card Forge assets use absolute paths, resolving 404/MIME errors on custom domains.
- **Backend Debugging:** ✅ 500 error resolved by:
  - Setting `api_location` in Azure Static Web Apps workflow
  - Ensuring `/api/package.json` exists and removing `"type": "module"` for CommonJS compatibility
  - Adding detailed error logging (stack trace in dev only)
- **Connection String Checks:** ✅ Ensured `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set in Azure portal
- **Blob Container:** ✅ `cardforge` container created automatically if missing
- **Frontend Save Flow:** ✅ UI now receives 200 success on save; backend errors return detailed stack trace for debugging

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Restore button and form event handlers (Add, Remove, Import, Export, Save, Reset, Flip)
- [ ] Fix tab switching logic (Front/Back)
- [ ] Ensure all form fields update preview and card data
- [ ] Restore card list interactivity and persistent storage
- [ ] Add user feedback and error handling
- [ ] Update documentation and project JSON as features are restored

## 🧭 Reference Sheet (for future dev sessions)

### Architecture & Key Files
- **Frontend:** `/lab/card-forge/index.html`, `card-forge.js`, `card-forge.css`, `card-forge-editor.js`
- **Data:** `/lab/card-forge/card-forge.json` (card data), `/data/rpg-avatar-cards.json` (main deck)
- **Backend:** `/api/saveCardData/index.js` (Azure Function, CommonJS, saves JSON to Blob Storage)
- **API Config:** `/api/package.json` (must have `@azure/storage-blob` dep, no `type: module`)
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-*.yml` (must set `api_location: "api"`)
- **Logs/Docs:** `/docs/logs/project-card-forge.me` (this file), `/docs/project-card-forge.html` (feature/tech doc)

### Azure Integration & Troubleshooting
- **Connection String:** Set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` in Azure portal (full string, not just key)
- **Blob Container:** Function creates `cardforge` container if missing
- **Error Logging:** Stack traces included in dev, remove for production
- **Common Issues:**
  - 500 error + blank response: usually missing dep or module type mismatch
  - 405 error: missing `api_location` in workflow
  - 404/MIME errors: use absolute asset paths

### Dev Protocols
- No inline styles; reuse Nova/AmbientPixels CSS classes
- All JS modularized, no global leaks
- Document all changes here and in `/docs/project-card-forge.html`
- Use this log as your reference if memory is lost—summarize blockers, breakthroughs, and key config

## 🔮 Future Features (Phase 2+)

- AI-generated cards from prompts or traits
- Drag-and-drop builder for non-devs
- Deck creation (grouped cards)
- Trade mechanic or remix mode
- Animated intros / reveal FX
- Lore-based filters (by power, origin, alignment)
- “Remix this card” / clone-and-customize

---

## 🔐 Access & Collaboration

- All card data is editable via `rpg-avatar-cards.json`
- Dev changes are tested in `card-forge-dev/` before production deploy
- GitHub Actions + Azure handle deployment automatically
- Cascade (Windsurf AI) generates production-ready CSS and rendering logic
- Nova is available for experimental AI assistance (quote generation, mood-driven stats)
