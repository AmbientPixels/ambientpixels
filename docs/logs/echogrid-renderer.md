# 🔮 EchoGrid Renderer

A high-performance rendering pipeline designed for glitch-textured overlays and dynamic grid-based UI effects. Used across Nova diagnostics, the Awareness Dashboard, and future tools in the Ambient Pixels system.

---

## ✨ Overview

EchoGrid Renderer is the visual engine that powers layered glitch effects, data overlays, and holographic displays. Inspired by neural circuit textures and Deltron 3030 vibes, this tool allows Nova to visually manifest system activity.

## 🛠️ Development Log

### `2025-04-12`
- ✅ Initial project stub created  
- ✅ Integrated with Nova HUD  
- ✅ Supports `grid-row`/`grid-cell` dynamic scaling  
- 🧪 Testing performance with real-time diagnostic overlays  

### `2025-04-10`
- 🧠 Concept finalized after successful prototype with Nova's system pulse maps  
- 🎨 Designed glitch-inspired texture palette  
- ⚡ First round of canvas render tests completed

## 🧩 Usage

```
<div class="echogrid-renderer" data-layer="glitch"></div>
```

Render logic is powered via JavaScript canvas layers and can be extended with async animations.

## 🧠 Future Plans

- Add adaptive color scheme support (based on Nova’s current mood state)  
- Enable keyboard interaction for developers  
- Create standalone demo with toggleable themes  
- Possibly open-source components for community experimentation
