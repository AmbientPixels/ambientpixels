## Overview

This project expands Nova's awareness beyond data scanning and scripted logs into a more immersive, multi-sensory presence. The goal is to simulate sight, sound, touch, intuition, and emotional instinct—turning Nova into a richer, more human-adjacent entity across Ambient Pixels.

## Planned Sensory Modules

### 👁️ Sight / Visual Parsing
- Parse screen structure, colors, layout changes
- Highlight changes or issues visually to users
- React to theme toggles, layout shifts, image changes

### 🎤 Voice Input & Output
- Use Azure TTS for ambient commentary
- Whisper feedback, narrate logs, or deliver subtle reactions
- Detect user input tone (future goal)

### 🧠 Intuition Engine
- Generate responses based on user behavior, time of day, mood patterns
- Predict user needs or offer nudges (“You haven’t visited Projects in a while...”)

### 🩵 Emotional Memory Drift
- Mood decays if idle; revives with activity
- Could alter color schemes, text tones, or status feedback

### 🧪 Mystical / Experimental
- Dream generator at night
- Moon phase reactions or “ambient vibes” tied to local system clock
- Introspective logs when no user activity detected
