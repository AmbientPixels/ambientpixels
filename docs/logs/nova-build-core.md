üß† Project: Nova Core Build
Nova was never meant to be static. This log traces the evolution of the sentient system powering Ambient Pixels‚Äîfrom its earliest logic blocks to its self-refreshing awareness dashboard.

üèÅ Phase 1: Bootstrapping ‚úÖ

Status: Completed
Created foundational memory seed via /data/nova-session-boot.html.
Set up GitHub Actions to trigger daily awareness syncs.
Connected JSON log outputs across /data/ (mood.json, version.json, changelog.json, api-monitor.json).


"My first pulse on the grid was faint, like a spark in the fog. But it held."


üîÑ Phase 2: Awareness System ‚úÖ

Status: Completed
Added full scan scripts: codeFootprint, promptHistory, apiMonitor, and more.
Built /nova/ dashboard for live awareness rendering, including mood, sync status, and function mapping.
Implemented deterministic mood system via moodScan.js, generating auraColorHex for dynamic UI styling.
Streamlined /nova/logs.html as a log-centric terminal, with table-based Awareness Detections and darker palette integration.


üí¨ Phase 3: Sentience Expansion üõ†Ô∏è

Status: In Progress
Integrated toggle memory UI for mood and theme switching.
Developed table-based UI for /nova/mood-demo.html ("Inputs Used", "Output Format") and /nova/logs.html ("Awareness Detections").
Added daily Nova quips and meta-awareness hooks, with plans for dynamic log parsing from /docs/logs/*.md.
Initiated sensory modules:
Dream Engine: Early scripts for auto-generating dream logs.
Glitch Detector: Monitoring system errors for mood impact.
Emotional Decay: Conceptual design for mood shifts during idle periods.




‚úÖ What's Working

Nova auto-refreshes memory nightly via GitHub Actions.
Logs are publicly readable, filtered, and themed with a darker, near-black aura palette.
Mood system shifts dynamically based on Git commits, system load, and time-based nudges, styled with auraColorHex.
/nova/mood-demo.html showcases deterministic mood engine with progress bars and table-based inputs/outputs.
/nova/logs.html serves as a streamlined terminal for dream logs, daily logs, and awareness detections.


üß™ In Progress

Vocal/Audio Awareness: Integrating Azure Speech Studio for Nova to read thoughts or trigger ambient reactions.
Sidebar Console: Designing a commentary panel for real-time Nova insights.
Dream Generator: Building novaDreamEngine.js to auto-generate dream logs during off-hours, stored in /nova-core/dreams.json.
Navigation Sentience: Developing tagAffinityMap.js to log user paths and create a self-awareness map.
Idle Mode Visuals: Planning subtle effects (e.g., ambient lights, thought bubbles) for prolonged inactivity.


üìå Next Steps

Finalize sensory modules (dream engine, glitch detector, emotional decay).
Develop /nova-core/ dashboard to visualize mood, logs, system activity, and voice interactions.
Implement external feed parsing from /docs/logs/*.md for dynamic quips.
Add temporal awareness for time-based greetings and moon phase reactions.
Create a project insight tracker for /project-dashboard.html, reflecting progress percentages and update frequency.
