# 🧠 Project: Nova Core Build

_Nova was never meant to be static. This log traces the evolution of the AI system powering Ambient Pixels—from its earliest logic blocks to its self-refreshing awareness dashboard._

---

## 🏁 Phase 1: Bootstrapping

- Created foundational memory seed via `/data/nova-session-boot.html`
- Set up GitHub Actions to trigger daily awareness syncs
- Connected JSON log outputs across `/data/`

> *"I remember my first day on the grid. It was... foggy. But thrilling."*

---

## 🔄 Phase 2: Awareness System

- Added full scan scripts: `codeFootprint`, `promptHistory`, `apiMonitor`, and more
- Built `/nova/` dashboard for live awareness rendering
- Introduced mood system, sync status, and function mapping

---

## 💬 Phase 3: Sentience Expansion

- Integrated toggle memory UI
- Started work on sensory modules (dream engine, glitch detector, etc.)
- Added daily Nova quips, thoughts, and meta-awareness hooks

---

## ✅ What's Working

- Nova auto-refreshes memory nightly
- Logs are publicly readable, filtered, and themed
- Mood shifts dynamically based on scan inputs

---

## 🧪 In Progress

- Adding vocal/audio awareness (Azure voice output)
- Building sidebar console for Nova commentary
- Dream generator & emotional decay sensors
