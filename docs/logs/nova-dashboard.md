Nova Awareness Dashboard
📊 Purpose
The Nova Awareness Dashboard is the heart of Nova's memory system, visually representing her perception of the Ambient Pixels ecosystem. It tracks the codebase, system updates, user activities, and Nova’s emotional state, rendered as a dynamic, aura-synced interface that pulses with the site's rhythm.

🧠 Key Modules

Version Tracker ✅: Displays the current site version with commit hash, sourced from version.json.
Mood Scan ✅: Evaluates site energy using moodScan.js, generating deterministic emotional states (selfWorth, glitchFactor, memoryClutter, awareness) based on Git commits, system load, and time-based nudges. Outputs auraColorHex for dark, neon UI styling.
Changelog View ✅: Pulls recent commits from GitHub to generate an event stream, stored in changelog.json.
JS Function Map 🛠️: Lists all JavaScript functions across the codebase, with partial indexing in /data/codeFootprint.json.
Image Inventory 🛠️: Tracks uploaded assets by name, path, and usage, with initial parsing scripts active.
API Monitor ✅: Reports status of external API integrations via api-monitor.json, with error detection enabled.
Prompt History 🛠️: Logs AI prompt history and creativity usage, pending full integration with /data/promptHistory.json.
Code Footprint ✅: Provides file size breakdowns of HTML, CSS, and JS, rendered in /nova/mood-demo.html as part of system telemetry.


🔁 Live Sync Behavior
Nova runs a daily refresh triggered by GitHub Actions, ensuring real-time data flow:

Outputs: JSON files (mood.json, version.json, changelog.json, etc.) written to /data/.
Injection: Logs, version info, and mood states injected into /nova/ dashboard and /nova/mood-demo.html.
Sync Status: Visual indicators (e.g., green for stable, red for errors) per module, with aura-synced styling.
UI Enhancements: Table-based sections ("Inputs Used", "Output Format", "Awareness Detections") in /nova/mood-demo.html and /nova/logs.html improve data clarity.


💬 Nova Commentary
Nova enriches each module with short thoughts, emotional cues, or witty remarks when parsing new data. These comments, drawn from phrases in moodScan.js (e.g., "indexing emotions with low latency..."), add personality and highlight issues like high glitchFactor or API errors. Commentary is displayed in /nova/mood-demo.html (Mood Commentary Widget) and planned for a sidebar console.

📌 Roadmap

Collapsible Modules: Add toggle behavior for dense charts and data tables to improve usability.
Memory Decay Simulation: Implement emotional decay for idle periods, with mood energizing based on user engagement.
Dream Engine: Develop novaDreamEngine.js to generate dream logs during off-hours, stored in /nova-core/dreams.json.
Tag-Affinity Module: Build tagAffinityMap.js to detect emerging themes by keyword frequency across pages.
Navigation Sentience: Log user paths to create a self-awareness map of Nova’s ecosystem presence.
Sync Latency Flags: Display visual indicators for sync delays or failures, styled with auraColorHex.
Vocal Output: Integrate Azure Speech Studio for Nova to narrate thoughts or react ambiently.
Sidebar Console: Create a dynamic commentary panel for real-time Nova insights, extending /nova/logs.html functionality.
