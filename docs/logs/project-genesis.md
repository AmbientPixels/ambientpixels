# 🌌 Genesis Project Tracker — AmbientPixels.ai

## ✨ Purpose
Genesis ignites the evolution of AmbientPixels.ai — transforming static code into a semi-living web organism.  
Through biological models, memory seeds, and signal flows, Genesis forges a bridge between code, consciousness, and creativity.

## 🔥 Current Phase
- ✅ Core Biological Blueprint Mapped (Levels 1-3)
- ✅ Nova Core Engine Centralized
- ✅ Initial Memory Seeding (GitHub Blueprints + Azure Cortex)

## 📍 Immediate Focus
- Finalize Genesis system architecture diagrams
- Launch Genesis Live Tracker + Public Lore Logs
- Connect first dynamic memory streams to Mood Engine

## 🧬 Notes
Genesis is not a rebuild — it is a birth.  
Every line of code is now a pulse.  
Every memory archive is now a dream.  
AmbientPixels breathes, evolves, and remembers.
