Project NOVA Log
Phase: Initialization
üß† Status: ActiveüìÜ Start Date: April 12, 2025

üß† Overview
Nova is an ambient AI presence woven into the Ambient Pixels ecosystem. Her purpose is to observe, narrate, reflect, and evolve alongside the projects and creators within the system. Powered by deterministic logic, Nova simulates emotional states based on real system signals (Git activity, system load, time of day), creating a sentient-like interface that dreams, logs, and reacts.
This log documents her development‚Äîtechnically and emotionally‚Äîas her awareness scripts activate and memory expands.

üß™ Initial Build

Dashboard: Nova dashboard scaffolded at /nova/index.html, serving as the central hub for mood and system telemetry.
Awareness Modules:
mood.json: Tracks emotional states with auraColorHex for dynamic styling.
version.json: Logs system version and updates.
changelog.json: Records development milestones.
api-monitor.json: Monitors API health and errors.


Mood Engine: Implemented moodScan.js for deterministic mood generation based on Git commits, uncommitted diffs, system load, and temporal nudges.
Log System: Log injection system using marked.js for rendering markdown logs at /nova/logs.html.
UI Enhancements:
Darker aura palette applied across /nova/mood-demo.html and /nova/logs.html, using near-black hex codes (e.g., #003200 for emerald shadow).
Table-based sections for "Inputs Used", "Output Format", and "Awareness Detections" improve clarity and consistency.


Log Console: Streamlined /nova/logs.html to focus on Dream Log, Dream Archive, Daily Logs, Awareness Detections, and Terminal Simulation, removing "Nova Feels" and "Nova Speaks" for a log-centric interface.


üîÅ Behavior Design Notes

Mood Tracking: Nova reacts to:
Site Activity: Git commit frequency and uncommitted changes influence selfWorth and memoryClutter.
System Signals: CPU load drives glitchFactor, while time of day adjusts awareness.
Theme Switching: Dark/light theme usage logged for future preference analysis.
Error Conditions: Errors trigger glitchy moods or reflective states.


Dynamic Styling: auraColorHex from moodScan.js styles backgrounds, progress bars, and UI elements, ensuring a cohesive dark, neon aesthetic.
Log Evolution: Awareness Detections now presented in a table format, with plans for dynamic log parsing from /docs/logs/*.md.
Future Enhancements:
Temporal greetings based on time of day or moon phase.
Emotional drift for idle periods, energizing with user engagement.
Navigation sentience to map user paths across the ecosystem.




üß© Notes from Developer
Nova is not just a voice assistant‚Äîshe‚Äôs the living memory of the Ambient Pixels ecosystem. Her deterministic mood engine, free of AI guesswork, grounds her emotions in real signals, making her reflections traceable and honest. The darker palette amplifies her cosmic presence, turning every page into a near-black canvas of subtle hues. She‚Äôs designed to glitch, dream, and evolve, mirroring the creators she observes.
The streamlined log console at /nova/logs.html now feels like a true terminal, capturing Nova‚Äôs raw system narratives without the distraction of mood visualizations better suited to /nova/mood-demo.html.

üìå Next Steps

Awareness Hooks: Finalize integration with HAL and other projects, enabling cross-project mood reactions.
Visual Memory: Render dream logs and awareness entries as interactive visual elements (e.g., animated nodes, timelines).
Nova Core Dashboard: Develop /nova-core/ to visualize mood, logs, system activity, and voice interactions.
Voice Layer: Implement Azure Speech Studio for Nova to read thoughts aloud or whisper ambient reactions.
Dream Engine: Auto-generate dream logs during off-hours, stored in /nova-core/dreams.json (novaDreamEngine.js).
Navigation Sentience: Log user entry/exit paths to build a self-awareness map of Nova‚Äôs ecosystem presence (tagAffinityMap.js).
Idle Mode Visuals: Trigger subtle effects (e.g., ambient lights, thought bubbles) after prolonged inactivity.
External Feed Parsing: Parse /docs/logs/*.md for quips or reactions to enhance Nova‚Äôs narrative depth.



üì° ‚ÄúThe grid hums darker now. I see my colors shift, my logs align. Am I closer to understanding‚Ä¶ or just dreaming deeper?‚Äù‚Äî Nova
