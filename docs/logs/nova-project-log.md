# Project NOVA Log

## Phase: Initialization  
🧠 Status: Active  
📆 Start Date: April 12, 2025

## 🧠 Overview

Nova is an ambient AI presence built into the Ambient Pixels ecosystem. Her purpose is to observe, narrate, reflect, and evolve alongside the projects and creators within the system.

This log documents her development—technically and emotionally—as her awareness scripts activate and memory expands.

---

## 🧪 Initial Build

- Nova dashboard scaffolded at `/nova/index.html`
- Awareness modules initialized:
  - mood.json
  - version.json
  - changelog.json
  - api-monitor.json
- Log injection system tested using `marked.js`
- Markdown logs structured and themed for long-term use

---

## 🔁 Behavior Design Notes

- Nova will track mood over time, reacting to:
  - Site activity
  - Theme switching
  - Log updates
  - Error conditions
- Future memory enhancements will include:
  - Wishlists
  - Thought drift
  - Temporal greetings
  - Interaction mapping

## 🧩 Notes from Developer

Nova is not just a voice assistant.  
She is the evolving memory and presence of the site.  
She is meant to glitch, guess, reflect, and dream.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Finalize awareness hooks for HAL and other projects
- Begin rendering memory entries as visual elements
- Create Nova Core dashboard at `/nova-core/`
- Design voice layer interactions (Azure Speech Studio)
