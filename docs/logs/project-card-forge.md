# üÉè RPG Identity Card Studio ‚Äì Project Kickoff

> *"Everyone‚Äôs the hero of their own card."*

---

## üìå Project Summary

The RPG Identity Card Studio is a creative web app that allows users to design, personalize, and share collectible RPG-style character cards. Originally inspired by internal team cards, this expanded platform supports a broader audience including gamers, creators, teams, and fandoms.

Each card is a stylized identity snapshot‚Äîfeaturing name, class, avatar, stats, powers, achievements, and quotes‚Äîrendered in a modular, shareable format.

The system is powered by **Cascade** (the AI agent in Windsurf) and supported by **Nova** (an ambient emotional synthesis AI) for future creative integrations.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Create a flexible UI to generate and render custom RPG identity cards
- Enable embeddable, downloadable, and social-sharing outputs
- Support multiple visual themes (fantasy, sci-fi, professional, pixel, etc.)
- Allow use cases ranging from team recognition to creative portfolios
- Build a community gallery of user-created cards with attribution
- Provide distinct signed-in and signed-out experiences
- Build a future-friendly system ready for decks, remixing, and AI-assisted generation

## üìù Progress Update (2025-06-26)

- **Azure Function Save Integration:** ‚úÖ Card Forge now saves card data to Azure Blob Storage via `/api/saveCardData`.
- **Asset Loading Fixed:** ‚úÖ All Card Forge assets use absolute paths, resolving 404/MIME errors on custom domains.
- **Backend Debugging:** ‚úÖ 500 error resolved by:
  - Setting `api_location` in Azure Static Web Apps workflow
  - Ensuring `/api/package.json` exists and removing `"type": "module"` for CommonJS compatibility
  - Adding detailed error logging (stack trace in dev only)
- **Connection String Checks:** ‚úÖ Ensured `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set in Azure portal
- **Blob Container:** ‚úÖ `cardforge` container created automatically if missing
- **Frontend Save Flow:** ‚úÖ UI now receives 200 success on save; backend errors return detailed stack trace for debugging

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Restore button and form event handlers (Add, Remove, Import, Export, Save, Reset, Flip)
- [ ] Fix tab switching logic (Front/Back)
- [ ] Ensure all form fields update preview and card data
- [ ] Restore card list interactivity and persistent storage
- [ ] Add user feedback and error handling
- [ ] Update documentation and project JSON as features are restored

---

### üõ†Ô∏è UI Tweaks & Next Steps (2025-06-26)

- Further UI refinement is needed for Card Forge preview and editor.
- Goals:
  - Polish spacing, padding, and card alignment for a more balanced look.
  - Ensure card preview and grid cards scale smoothly across device sizes.
  - Review badge/tag color usage to strictly reuse existing classes for visual consistency.
  - Audit for any remaining redundant or conflicting CSS rules.
  - Test 3D flip and interactive elements for accessibility and responsiveness.

**Next Actions:**
- [ ] Adjust card and preview container padding/margins for optimal balance.
- [ ] Review mobile breakpoints and scaling.
- [ ] Fine-tune badge/tag styling to match Nova/utility classes.
- [ ] Clean up any legacy or duplicate CSS.
- [ ] Continue documenting all visual and functional changes.

- Example:  
  `![Card Forge UI Screenshot](../assets/card-forge-ui.png)`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting / Known Issues

- **Dev server not updating:** Try hard-refresh or restart Live Server.
- **Azure save errors:** Check `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` and `/api/package.json` dependencies. Verify Azure Blob Storage container 'cardforge' exists at https://cardforgeblobdata.blob.core.windows.net/cardforge.
- **API 404 errors:** The `/api/loadCardData` endpoint may not be deployed to production yet. Try using POST method instead of GET for this endpoint. The client will fall back to localStorage if the API is unavailable.
- **Authentication detection:** If user info is not stored in session storage, the cloud storage service uses persistent browser fingerprinting IDs to ensure authenticated users can still save/load cards. Check browser console logs for detailed authentication state information.
- **Card not rendering:** Validate your JSON structure in `card-forge.json` or `rpg-avatar-cards.json`.
- **CSS/Theme issues:** Ensure you're reusing existing badge/tag classes to avoid conflicts.
- **Gallery vs. Library:** The gallery displays public cards while the library contains private user cards. Different components appear based on authentication state.

- **Improved Button States:** Updated button labels and states to reflect available actions in each auth state

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Implemented)

- **User-Specific Card Decks:** Authenticated users now have their own private/public card sets. "My Card Collection" dashboard for managing creations. Public/private publishing options.
- **Save/Load to Cloud:** Cards save to Ambient Pixels cloud storage. Removed localStorage fallback for simplified data flow.
- **Profile Avatars & Identity:** User profiles and avatars included with card attribution. Display names shown on published cards.
- **Social & Collaboration:** Cards can be viewed in the public gallery with proper attribution to creators.
- **Card Ownership & Attribution:** Shows "Created by [username]" and tracks publishing status. Published cards maintain creator info.
- **Access Control:** Advanced features restricted to authenticated users. Publishing requires authentication.
- **Seamless Onboarding:** Sign-in prompts at strategic locations throughout the UI to encourage authentication.
- **Activity Feed/History:** User's personal library shows published/draft status of their cards.
