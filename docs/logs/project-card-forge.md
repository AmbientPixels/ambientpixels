# üÉè RPG Identity Card Studio ‚Äì Project Kickoff

> *"Everyone‚Äôs the hero of their own card."*

---

## üìå Project Summary

The RPG Identity Card Studio is a creative web app that allows users to design, personalize, and share collectible RPG-style character cards. Originally inspired by internal team cards, this expanded platform supports a broader audience including gamers, creators, teams, and fandoms.

Each card is a stylized identity snapshot‚Äîfeaturing name, class, avatar, stats, powers, achievements, and quotes‚Äîrendered in a modular, shareable format.

The system is powered by **Cascade** (the AI agent in Windsurf) and supported by **Nova** (an ambient emotional synthesis AI) for future creative integrations.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Create a flexible UI to generate and render custom RPG identity cards
- Enable embeddable, downloadable, and social-sharing outputs
- Support multiple visual themes (fantasy, sci-fi, professional, pixel, etc.)
- Allow use cases ranging from team recognition to creative portfolios
- Build a future-friendly system ready for decks, remixing, and AI-assisted generation

## üìù Progress Update (2025-06-26)

- **Azure Function Save Integration:** ‚úÖ Card Forge now saves card data to Azure Blob Storage via `/api/saveCardData`.
- **Asset Loading Fixed:** ‚úÖ All Card Forge assets use absolute paths, resolving 404/MIME errors on custom domains.
- **Backend Debugging:** ‚úÖ 500 error resolved by:
  - Setting `api_location` in Azure Static Web Apps workflow
  - Ensuring `/api/package.json` exists and removing `"type": "module"` for CommonJS compatibility
  - Adding detailed error logging (stack trace in dev only)
- **Connection String Checks:** ‚úÖ Ensured `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set in Azure portal
- **Blob Container:** ‚úÖ `cardforge` container created automatically if missing
- **Frontend Save Flow:** ‚úÖ UI now receives 200 success on save; backend errors return detailed stack trace for debugging

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Restore button and form event handlers (Add, Remove, Import, Export, Save, Reset, Flip)
- [ ] Fix tab switching logic (Front/Back)
- [ ] Ensure all form fields update preview and card data
- [ ] Restore card list interactivity and persistent storage
- [ ] Add user feedback and error handling
- [ ] Update documentation and project JSON as features are restored

## üß≠ Reference Sheet (for future dev sessions)

### Architecture & Key Files
- **Frontend:** `/lab/card-forge/index.html`, `card-forge.js`, `card-forge.css`, `card-forge-editor.js`
- **Data:** `/lab/card-forge/card-forge.json` (card data), `/data/rpg-avatar-cards.json` (main deck)
- **Backend:** `/api/saveCardData/index.js` (Azure Function, CommonJS, saves JSON to Blob Storage)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è UI Tweaks & Next Steps (2025-06-26)

- Further UI refinement is needed for Card Forge preview and editor.
- Goals:
  - Polish spacing, padding, and card alignment for a more balanced look.
  - Ensure card preview and grid cards scale smoothly across device sizes.
  - Review badge/tag color usage to strictly reuse existing classes for visual consistency.
  - Audit for any remaining redundant or conflicting CSS rules.
  - Test 3D flip and interactive elements for accessibility and responsiveness.

**Next Actions:**
- [ ] Adjust card and preview container padding/margins for optimal balance.
- [ ] Review mobile breakpoints and scaling.
- [ ] Fine-tune badge/tag styling to match Nova/utility classes.
- [ ] Clean up any legacy or duplicate CSS.
- [ ] Continue documenting all visual and functional changes.

---
- **API Config:** `/api/package.json` (must have `@azure/storage-blob` dep, no `type: module`)
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-*.yml` (must set `api_location: "api"`)
- **Logs/Docs:** `/docs/logs/project-card-forge.me` (this file), `/docs/project-card-forge.html` (feature/tech doc)
