# 🃏 RPG Identity Card Studio – Project Kickoff

> *"Everyone’s the hero of their own card."*

## 📌 Project Summary

The RPG Identity Card Studio is a creative web app that allows users to design, personalize, and share collectible RPG-style character cards. Originally inspired by internal team cards, this expanded platform targets a broader audience including gamers, creators, teams, and fandoms. Each card is a unique expression of identity—stats, powers, quotes, class, and style—rendered in a stylized, shareable format.
